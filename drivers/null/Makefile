#   Module Name:
#
#       Null
#
#   Abstract:
#
#       This module implements a null driver that simply passes all IRPs down.
#       It serves as an excellent skeleton for starting a new driver, and also
#       provides a handy stub driver for instances where all functionality is
#       provided by bus drivers or other mechanisms.
