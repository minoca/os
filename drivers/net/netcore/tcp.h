Structure Description:

    This structure defines a TCP data socket.

Members:

    NetSocket - Stores the common core networking parameters.

    ListEntry - Stores pointers to the previous and next sockets on the global
        list.

    State - Stores the connection state of the socket.

    PreviousState - Stores the previous state of the socket, to debug where
        transitions are coming from.

    Flags - Stores a bitmask of TCP flags. See TCP_SOCKET_FLAG_* for
        definitions.

    TimerReferenceCount - Supplies the reference count on the global TCP timer.
        If this value is non-zero, there is a single reference on the global
        TCP timer.

    SendInitialSequence - Stores the random offset that the sequence numbers
        started at for this socket.

    SendUnacknowledgedSequence - Stores the first unacknowledged sequence
        number, representing data that was sent but not acknowledged.

    SendNextBufferSequence - Stores the sequence number of the next byte
        accepted into the send buffer.

    SendNextNetworkSequence - Stores the sequence number of the next byte to
        be sent out of the network. This may be different than the next buffer
        sequence if data has been accepted into the send buffer but not yet
        actually sent out on the wire.

    SendMaxSegmentSize - Stores the maximum segment size for outgoing packets.

    SendWindowScale - Stores the number of bits to shift the window size left
        by for incoming packets.

    SendWindowSize - Stores the size of the window of data that can be sent out
        to the remote host.

    SendWindowUpdateSequence - Stores the sequence number of the packet when the
        send window was last updated. This is used to prevent old packets from
        updating the send window.

    SendWindowUpdateAcknowledge - Stores the acnknowledge number of the most
        recent packet used to update the send window. This is used to prevent
        old packets from updating the send window.

    SendBufferTotalSize - Stores the total size in the send buffer, in bytes.

    SendBufferFreeSize - Stores the number of free bytes size in the send
        buffer.

    SendFinalSequence - Stores the outgoing sequence number of the sent or
        soon-to-be-sent FIN.

    PreviousAcknowledgeNumber - Stores the most recently received acknowledge
        number.

    DuplicateAcknowledgeCount - Stores the number of duplicate acknowledges
        that have come in. A value of 1 means two packets with the same
        acknowledge number have come in.

    ReceiveWindowTotalSize - Stores the total size of the local receive window,
        in bytes.

    ReceiveWindowFreeSize - Stores the current size of the local receive window,
        in bytes.

    ReceiveWindowScale - Stores the number of bits by which the window size
        must be shifted before being put into the header.

    ReceiveMinimum - Stores the minimum number of bytes that must be received
        before this socket becomes readable.

    ReceiveInitialSequence - Stores the random initial sequence number
        provided by the remote host.

    ReceiveUnreadSequence - Stores the sequence number of the first unread
        byte. This should be at the head of the received segment list.

    ReceiveNextSequence - Stores the next sequence number expected to be
        received from the remote host (the value to fill in the acknowledgment
        number).

    ReceiveFinalSequence - Stores the sequence number in which the FIN was
        sent.

    ReceiveSegmentOffset - Stores the offset in bytes into the first segment
        where the next user receive call will read from.

    ReceiveMaxSegmentSize - Stores the maximum segment size of packets received
        by the TCP socket.

    Lock - Store a pointer to a queued lock used to synchronize access to
        various parts of the structure.

    ReceivedSegmentList - Stores the head of the list of received segments that
        have not yet been read by the user. This list contains objects of type
        TCP_RECEIVED_SEGMENT, and is in order by sequence number.

    OutgoingSegmentList - Stores the list of segments that have either not yet
        been sent or have been sent but not acknowledged.

    FreeSegmentList - Stores the head of the list of segments that can be
        reused for send and receive.

    IncomingConnectionList - Stores the head of the list of incoming
        connections. This list only applies to a listening socket.

    IncomingConnectionCount - Stores the number of elements that are on the
        incoming connection list.

    SlowStartThreshold - Stores the threshold value for the congestion window.
        If the congestion window size is less than or equal to this value, then
        Slow Start is used. Otherwise, Congestion Avoidance is used.

    CongestionWindowSize - Stores the current size of the congestion window.

    FastRecoveryEndSequence - Stores the sequence number that when acknowledged
        will transition congestion control out of Fast Recovery back into
        Congestion Avoidance mode.

    RoundTripTime - Stores the latest estimate for the round trip time.

    TimeoutEnd - Stores the ending time, in time counter ticks, of the current
        timeout period. Depending on the state this could be the time-wait
        timeout, the SYN resend timeout, or the packet retransmit timeout.
        These three uses are mutually exclusive, so the timeout end can be
        safely shared.

    RetryTime - Stores the time, in time counter ticks, when the socket will
        retry sending a packet. Depending on the state, this could be a probe
        despite a zero window size, a resend of the SYN packet, or a resend of
        the FIN packet. These there uses are mutually exclusive, so the retry
        time can be safely shared.

    KeepAliveTime - Stores the time, in time counter ticks, when the socket
        will probe the remote host with a keep alive message.

    KeepAliveTimeout - Stores the time, in seconds, to wait after the
        connection goes idle before sending a keep alive probe.

    KeepAlivePeriod - Stores the time, in seconds, between sending keep alive
        probes on an idle connection.

    KeepAliveProbeLimit - Stores the number of keep alive probes to send before
        resetting the connection.

    KeepAliveProbeCount - Stores the current number of keep alive probes that
        have been sent without reply.

    RetryWaitPeriod - Stores the time in milliseconds for the socket to wait
        until it sends its next retry packet. This could be a probe on zero
        window, another SYN packet, or another FIN packet. These there uses are
        mutually exclusive, so the period can be safely shared.

    LingerTimeout - Stores the time, in milliseconds, that the socket will wait
        for all the data to be sent on close before forcefully closing the
        connection.

    SendTimeout - Stores the maximum time, in milliseconds, for the socket to
        wait until send buffer space becomes available.

    ReceiveTimeout - Stores the maximum time, in milliseconds, for the socket
        to wait until data is available to receive.

    ShutdownTypes - Stores a mask of the shutdown types that have occurred.
        See SOCKET_SHUTDOWN_* definitions.

    OutOfBandData - Stores a single urgent byte, or -1 if the urgent data is
        not valid.

    SegmentAllocationSize - Stores the allocation size for each of the send and
        receive TCP segments, including enough size for the header and data.

Structure Description:

    This structure defines a TCP packet protocol header.

Members:

    SourcePort - Stores the source port number of the packet.

    DestinationPort - Stores the port number of this packet's destination.

    SequenceNumber - Stores the position of this data within the stream.

    AcknowledgmentNumber - Stores the next sequence number that the sender
        expects to receive. This field is only valid if the ACK flag is on,
        which it always is once a connection is established.

    HeaderLength - Stores the length of the header, in 32-bit words.

    Flags - Stores a bitfield of flags used to relay control information
        between two peers.

    WindowSize - Stores the size of the advertised window of data the socket
        can receive from the other host.

    Checksum - Stores the checksum of the header and data.

    NonUrgentOffset - Stores the offset within the data where the non-urgent
        data begins. This field is only used if the urgent flag is set. RFC793
        is inconsistent as to whether this field points to the last urgent
        octet or the first non-urgent octet. RFC1122 attempted to clarify this
        as the last urgent octet, but all of today's implementations
        maintained the opposite semantics. Stick with tradition to be
        consistent with everyone else. RFC6093 sums this all up.
