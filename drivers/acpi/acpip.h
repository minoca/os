Structure Description:

    This structure stores information about an entry in a PCI routing table.

Members:

    Slot - Stores the PCI slot number of the entry being described.

    InterruptLine - Stores the interrupt line of the entry being described.
        Valid values are 0 through 3 and correspond to lines INTA through INTD.

    RoutingDevice - Stores a pointer to the namespace object of the routing
        device (link node) that this interrupt line routes through. This
        may be NULL if the interrupt line is directly connected to an
        interrupt controller.

    RoutingDeviceResourceIndex - Stores the zero-based resource index into
        the routing device's resources that represents the output routing of the
        slot's interrupt line.

    GlobalSystemInterruptNumber - Stores the global system interrupt number of
        the interrupt line when the line is directly connected to an
        interrupt controller (the routing device is NULL). If the routing
        device is not NULL, this parameter is unused.

Structure Description:

    This structure stores information about an ACPI device that has been

Members:

    ListEntry - Stores pointers to the next and previous device objects in the
        global list.

    NamespaceObject - Stores a pointer to the namespace object that
        corresponds to this device object.

    ParentObject - Stores an pointer to the parent device context, which can
        be used to traverse up even when the device has no object in the ACPI
        namespace.

    OsDevice - Stores a pointer to the operating system device object.

    ChildArray - Stores a pointer to an array of ACPI child structures outlining
        the previously enumerated children.

    ChildCount - Stores the number of elements in the child array.

    HasDependentDevices - Stores a boolean indicating if this device has
        devices that delayed starting because they were waiting for this device
        to come up.

    Flags - Stores a bitfield of flags concerning the device. See ACPI_DEVICE_*
        definitions.

    ResourceBuffer - Stores a pointer to an ACPI buffer object that contains
        the resources as laid out by the CRS function. This same format is used
        in the SRS function to set resources.

    PciRoutingTable - Stores a pointer to the PCI routing table. This pointer
        will only be non-NULL for PCI bus devices, for everything else this
        pointer is unused.

    BusAddress - Stores the bus address of this device (the result of
        evaluating the _ADR method under the device).

    Processor - Stores a pointer to additional context if this device is a
        processor.
