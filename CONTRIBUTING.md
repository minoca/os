# Contributing to Minoca OS

Minoca OS is a new project, and there is a ton of work to do. We need your help! If you're interested in writing features, porting drivers, fixing bugs, writing tests, creating documentation, filling out examples, or helping out in any other way, we'd love the help.

If you've already got an idea of what you'd like to work on, great. Check out our [wish list](https://github.com/minoca/os/blob/master/docs/WISHLIST.md) page if you're looking for ideas on what to work on.

### Contributor Agreement

We at Minoca are trying to make open source work as a business model. One of the ways we're doing that is by offering Minoca OS source for sale under more proprietary licensing terms. To do this Minoca needs to own the copyright to its source. In order to support this business model while also allowing community contributions, we ask that contributors sign a Contributor Assignment Agreement. We're using [Harmony Agreements](http://harmonyagreements.org/). Before submitting patches, please fill out the CAA for [individuals](https://www.minocacorp.com/ca/individual/) or [companies](https://www.minocacorp.com/ca/entity/).

### Submissions
Patches and submissions can be sent to minoca-dev@googlegroups.com. Security issues should be directed towards security@minocacorp.com.
