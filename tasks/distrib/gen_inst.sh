Minoca OS is a leading-edge, highly customizable, general purpose operating
system. It features application level functionality such as virtual memory,
networking, and POSIX compatibility, but at a significantly reduced image and
memory footprint. Unique development, debugging, and real-time profiling tools
make getting to the bottom of issues straightforward and easy. Direct support
from the development team behind Minoca OS simplifies the process of creating
OS images tailored to your application, saving on engineering resources and
development time. Minoca OS is a one-stop shop for systems-level design.

What is this?
=============
This archive contains the generic installation images and setup command line
app for creating custom images of Minoca OS. If you're looking to simply get
a quick bootable image of Minoca OS on a particular platform, this is not the
archive for you. Go download one of our prebuilt images, available for each
supported platform Minoca runs on.

Inside the archive are installation images for each supported processor
architecture. The Minoca native setup program for that architecture is also in
that architecture directory. If you're running setup on Minoca to install
Minoca, use the native setup programs.

Additionally there is a setup command line tool for Windows. Use this if you'd
like to install Minoca onto a removable disk from Windows. It is also possible
to install directly onto your host system. Make sure to create a backup before
trying to create a dual boot scenario. Currently the setup program will
install its own MBR, blowing away the capability to boot back into Windows
without a rescue disk. We recommend installing to removable media (such as a
USB disk or SD card), a blank disk, or a disk file (for use with a VM).


How do I use it?
================
Run msetup with no arguments to get a list of available installation locations,
including enumerated disks and partitions on the local machine. Use
msetup --help to get a list of command line options and ways to specialize your
image. You can install directly to a removable disk using its device ID number
(eg. msetup -vD -d0x10000).
