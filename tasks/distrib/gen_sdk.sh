Minoca OS is a leading-edge, highly customizable, general purpose operating
system. It features application level functionality such as virtual memory,
networking, and POSIX compatibility, but at a significantly reduced image and
memory footprint. Unique development, debugging, and real-time profiling tools
make getting to the bottom of issues straightforward and easy. Direct support
from the development team behind Minoca OS simplifies the process of creating
OS images tailored to your application, saving on engineering resources and
development time. Minoca OS is a one-stop shop for systems-level design.

This archive contains the Minoca OS SDK for Windows, which contains all the
compilers, build utilities, and headers you need to cross compile applications
and drivers for Minoca OS.


Host System Requirements
========================
Windows XP or later
512MB RAM
2GB Hard Disk space

Target System Requirements
==========================
Flexible. Functions best with at least 5MB RAM and 5MB disk space.

Installation
============
This archive requires no installation. Extract the contents of the downloaded
zip archive to the directory of your choice. Ideally this directory would be
near the root of the drive and contain no spaces in the path.


Environment
===========
The SDK environment builds from the command line. Double click one of the
run_x86.bat, run_armv7.bat, or run_armv6.bat files, which will set a few
environment variables and drop you into a Bourne shell. The environment is based
around three environment variables:
  * SRCROOT -- Defines the root of the source tree. The setenv.cmd script
    determines this based on its own path.
  * ARCH -- Defines the architecture to build for. This is either set to x86,
    armv6 or armv7 depending on .bat file used.
  * DEBUG -- Defines whether to compile with debugging checks ("dbg"), or
    without debugging checks ("rel"). This is set to "dbg", as it matches with
    the free edition binaries.

The various scripts make certain assumptions about the layout of directories
underneath SRCROOT. They assume that the following directories exist underneath
it:
  * tools -- Contains the compilers, build utilities (such as the shell and
    other core utilities), and other pieces of support infrastructure.
  * os -- Contains the SDK source.
  * third-party (optional) -- Contains the third party source packages not
    authored by Minoca.
  * x86dbg, x86qdbg, armv7dbg, armv6dbg -- These are actually
    $ARCH$VARIANT$DEBUG, and contain the build output. Each directory is
    created automatically when a build for its particular architecture is
    initiated. Notable directories inside of these include obj, the directory
    where object files, libraries, and executables are built, and bin, the
    directory where "final product" binaries are placed.

Building
========
When you double click one of the run_<arch>.bat, you're dropped into the source
root (SRCROOT). To build the samples, "cd" into the os directory, and run
"make". The application and driver samples should build. The final output
binaries will be located in "$SRCROOT/$ARCH$VARIANT$DEBUG/bin". There's a handy
alias installed, you can simply type "bin" to change to this directory.

You can build inside a specific directory by "cd"ing into it and running make
there (ie os/drivers/usb/onering). You can also run "make clean" from somewhere
inside os, which will remove the obj files for the directory you're in. The
contents of the "bin" directory are not cleared, though if you were to run a
subsequent "make", they would be updated.
