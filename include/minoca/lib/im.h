/*++

Structure Description:

    This structure stores information about a loaded executable image. Be
    careful moving members, as the first few members in this structure line up
    with the C library link_map structure.

Members:

    ListEntry - Stores pointers to the next and previous images. This is not
        used by the Image Library, and can be used by the subsystem managing
        the image library. This member lines up with the l_next and l_prev
        members of the link_map structure.

    FileName - Stores the complete path to the file. This member lines up with
        the l_name member of the link_map structure.

    BaseDifference - Stores the difference between the image's loaded lowest
        address and its preferred lowest address. That is, the loaded lowest
        address minus the preferred lowest address. This member lines up with
        the l_addr member of the link_map structure.

    DynamicSection - Stores a pointer to the dynamic section. This member
        lines up with the l_ld member of the link_map structure.

    LibraryName - Stores the name of the library, according to itself.

    Parent - Stores an optional pointer to the image that caused this image
        to need to be loaded.

    ModuleNumber - Stores the module identifier. This is not used by the image
        library, but can be assigned by the consumer of the image library.

    TlsOffset - Stores the offset from the thread pointer to the start of the
        static TLS block for this module. This only applies to modules using
        the static TLS regime. This will be initialized to -1 if the module
        has no TLS offset or is loaded dynamically.

    Format - Stores an integer indicating the binary image format.

    Machine - Stores the machine type for the image.

    File - Stores information about the file itself, including potentially an
        open handle to it during the load process.

    Size - Stores the size of the image as expanded in memory, in bytes.

    PreferredLowestAddress - Stores the image's default lowest virtual address.

    ImageContext - Stores a pointer to context specific to the image backend.

    LoadedImageBuffer - Stores a pointer to the image's in-memory layout. In
        a live system, this is probably the same as the actual loaded VA of the
        image. In offline situations, this may be a different buffer.
        Relocations and other modifications to the image are made through this
        pointer.

    SystemContext - Stores a pointer of context that gets passed to system
        backend functions.

    AllocatorHandle - Stores the handle associated with the overall allocation
        of virtual address space.

    SegmentCount - Stores the number of segments in the loaded image.

    Segments - Stores a pointer to the loaded image segments.

    EntryPoint - Stores the entry point of the image. This pointer is
        absolute (it has already been rebased).

    ReferenceCount - Stores the reference count on this image.

    ExportSymbolTable - Stores a pointer to the export symbol table.

    ExportStringTable - Stores a pointer to the export string table.

    ExportStringTableSize - Stores the size of the export string table in bytes.

    ExportHashTable - Stores a pointer to the export hash table, not used in
        all image formats.

    PltRelocations - Stores a pointer to the procedure linkage table relocation
        section.

    PltRelocationsAddends - Stores a boolean indicating if the PLT relocations
        are of type REL (FALSE) or RELA (TRUE).

    ImportDepth - Stores the import depth of the image (the number of images
        between the image and some image that was actually requested to be
        loaded). An image's imports, unless already loaded, have an import
        depth of one greater than the image itself.

    ImportCount - Stores the number of import images this image requires.

    Imports - Stores a pointer to an array of loaded images that this image
        imports from.

    TlsImage - Stores a pointer to the thread-local storage initialization
        data.

    TlsImageSize - Stores the size of the thread-local storage initialization
        data, in bytes.

    TlsSize - Stores the size of the thread-local storage region, in bytes.
        This may be bigger than the TLS image size if there is uninitialized
        data.

    TlsAlignment - Stores the alignment requirement of the TLS section.

    DebuggerModule - Stores an optional pointer to the debugger's module
        information if this module is loaded in the kernel debugger.

    SystemExtension - Stores a pointer to the additional information the
        system stores attached to this image.

    Flags - Stores internal image flags. See IMAGE_FLAG_* definitions.

    LoadFlags - Stores the flags passed in when the image load was requested.

    StaticFunctions - Stores an optional pointer to an array of static
        functions.

    VisitMarker - Stores space for the address search routine to mark nodes
        as visited so as to avoid cycles.

    Debug - Stores debug information.
