    StandardName - Supplies an optional pointer where a pointer to the standard
        time zone name will be returned on success. The caller must not modify
        this memory, and it may change if the time zone is changed.

    DaylightName - Supplies an optional pointer where a pointer to the Daylight
        Saving time zone name will be returned on success. The caller must not
        modify this memory, and it may change if the time zone is changed.

    StandardGmtOffset - Supplies an optional pointer where the offset from GMT
        in seconds will be returned for the time zone.

    DaylightGmtOffset - Supplies an optional pointer where the offset from GMT
        in seconds during Daylight Saving will be returned.

/*++

Routine Description:

    This routine selects a time zone from the current set of data.

Arguments:

    ZoneName - Supplies an optional pointer to a null terminated string
        containing the name of the time zone. If this parameter is NULL then
        the current time zone will simply be returned.

    OriginalZoneBuffer - Supplies an optional pointer where the original (or
        current if no new time zone was provided) time zone will be returned.

    OriginalZoneBufferSize - Supplies a pointer that on input contains the
        size of the original zone buffer in bytes. On output, this value will
        contain the size of the original zone buffer needed to contain the
        name of the current time zone (even if no buffer was provided).

Return Value:

    STATUS_SUCCESS on success.

    STATUS_NOT_FOUND if a time zone with the given name could not be found.

    STATUS_NO_DATA_AVAILABLE if no time zone data has been set yet.

    STATUS_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL if the buffer provided to get the original time
        zone name was too small. If this is the case, the new time zone will
        not have been set.
