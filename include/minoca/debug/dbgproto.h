Structure Description:

    This structure defines what a debug packet header looks like being sent
    across the wire. It is assumed values are being sent in little endian order.

Members:

    Magic - Stores a magic value that signifies the start of a packet. This
        field is used to get the host and target in sync.

    Command - Stores the definition for the contents of the payload. This could
        either be a command from the debugger or a response from the debuggee.

    Checksum - Stores the checksum of the entire packet, including the packet
        header and the payload. The only field not checksummed is the checksum
        field itself, which is taken to be zero.

    PayloadSize - Stores the size of the rest of the packet, which follows
        immediately after this field.

    PayloadSizeComplement - Stores the one's complement of the payload size,
        for header validation.

    Padding - Stores padding to align the structure.

Structure Description:

    This structure stores information about a "range" breakpoint. The range
    break essentially breaks within a certain range of addresses. It also
    allows a small exception to this range (ie. for the current source line).
    The range step is much slower than a regular breakpoint since it is
    implemented by putting the processor into single step mode and manually
    checking the range at every instruction.

Members:

    BreakRangeMinimum - Stores the first valid address in the breakpoint range.

    BreakRangeMaximum - Stores the first invalid address in the breakpoint
        range. Said differently, everything below (but not including) this
        address is in the break range.

    RangeHoleMinimum - Stores the start of a hole in the break range.
        Addresses in the hole do not cause a breakpoint.

    RangeHoleMaximum - Stores the first invalid address in the range hole.
