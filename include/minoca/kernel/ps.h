Structure Description:

    This structure stores information about a group of processes that
    interact with their controlling terminal as a unit.

Members:

    ListEntry - Stores pointers to the next and previous process groups in the
        global list.

    ReferenceCount - Stores the number of outstanding references to this
        process group. This structure will be automatically destroyed when the
        reference count hits zero.

    Identifier - Stores the identifier for this process group, which is usually
        the identifier of the process that created the process group.

    ProcessListHead - Stores the head of the list of processes in the group.

    SessionId - Stores the session identifier the process group belongs to.

    OutsideParents - Stores the number of processes with living parents outside
        the process group. When the number of processes in a process group with
        parents outside the process group (but inside the session) drops to
        zero, the process is considered orphaned as there is no one to do job
        control on it.

        set-UID program, or the user ID of the executable if the executable had
        the set-UID file permission set.

    RealGroupId - Stores the group identifier of the user that created the

    EffectiveGroupId - Stores the group ID actively used in file and permission
        checks.

        PROCESS_START_DATA_VERSION. Newer versions will be backwards compatible
        with older versions.

    PageSize - Stores the system page size.

    Identity - Stores the thread identity of the new process.

    Base - Stores the base address of the interpreter or executable.

    InterpreterBase - Stores the base address of the program interpreter, or
        0 if no intepreter was requested.

    OsLibraryBase - Stores the base address of the Minoca OS library, loaded
        into every address space.

    ExecutableBase - Stores the base address of the executable.

    EntryPoint - Stores the initial entry point, either into the interpreter
        if there was one or into the executable if not.

Structure Description:

    Arguments - Stores a pointer to an array of pointers to null terminated
        strings representing the arguments to be passed to the main function
        (in the argv parameter). The first argument will be the same as the
        image name pointer.

    ArgumentCount - Stores the element count of the arguments array (which
        can be passed directly as the argc parameter to the main function).

    ArgumentsBuffer - Stores a pointer to the buffer containing the image name
        and arguments strings.

    ArgumentsBufferLength - Stores the size of the arguments buffer, in bytes.

    Environment - Stores a pointer to an array of null terminated strings
        representing the execution environment of the process. This array can
        be assigned directly to the environ C library variable.

    EnvironmentCount - Stores the number of environment variable definitions.

    EnvironmentBuffer - Stores a pointer to the buffer used to hold environment
        variable strings.

    EnvironmentBufferLength - Stores the length of the environment buffer, in
        bytes.

        itself.

    State - Stores the executable state of the thread.

    SignalPending - Stores a value indicating if a signal is pending on this
        thread or perhaps on the process. The synchronization of this variable

    Flags - Stores the bitfield of flags the thread was created with. See
        THREAD_FLAG_* definitions.

    FpuFlags - Stores the bitfield of floating point unit flags governing the

        during context switch, which can land on top of other kernel level flag
        manipulation.

    SchedulerEntry - Stores the scheduler information for this thread.

    BuiltinTimer - Stores a pointer to the thread's default timeout timer.

    BuiltinWaitBlock - Stores a pointer to the built-in wait block that comes

    SignalListHead - Stores the head of the list of signals that are currently

    ResourceUsage - Stores the resource usage of the thread.

    FpuContext - Stores a pointer to the saved extended state if user mode
        is currently using the floating point unit.

    Identity - Stores the thread's user and group identity.

    SupplementaryGroups - Stores a pointer to the first block of the thread's
        supplementary groups.

    Permissions - Stores the thread's permission masks.

    ThreadRoutine - Stores the location to jump to on first execution of this

    KernelStackSize - Stores the size, in bytes, of the kernel stack.

    UserStack - Stores the base (limit) of the user-mode stack for this thread.

    UserStackSize - Stores the size of the user-mode stack for this thread.

    ThreadId - Stores the thread's system-unique ID.

    ThreadIdPointer - Stores an optional pointer in user mode. If a thread is
        terminated, zero will be written to this value by the kernel and a
        UserLockWake operation will be performed to wake one thread waiting on
        that address. This is used so that threads can reliably wait for
        other threads termination.

    ProcessEntry - Stores pointers to the previous and next threads in the
        process that owns this thread.

    TrapFrame - Stores a pointer to the user mode trap frame saved for this
        thread by the system call handler.

    RealTimer - Stores an optional pointer to the real-time interval timer.

    UserTimer - Stores the per-thread timer that tracks user mode execution
        time.

    ProfileTimer - Stores the per-thread timer that tracks user plus kernel
        execution time.

Arguments:

    AllocationTag - Supplies the allocation tag to use for the allocation
        this routine will make on behalf of the caller.

    Buffer - Supplies a pointer where a non-paged pool buffer will be returned
        containing the array of process information. The caller is responsible
        for freeing this memory from non-paged pool. The type returned here
