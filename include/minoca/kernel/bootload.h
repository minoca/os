Structure Description:

    This structure stores a region of reserved memory that may or may not
    already be marked in the firmware memory map. The boot manager uses these
    descriptors to stake out its own memory in the loader on legacy PC/AT
    systems.

Members:

    Address - Stores the base address of the reserved region.

    Size - Stores the size of the reserved region in bytes.

    Flags - Stores flags describing the region.

/*++

Structure Description:

    This structure stores the information passed between the boot manager and
    OS loader or other boot application. Future versions of this structure must
    be backwards compatible as newer boot managers may pass control over to
    older OS loaders. Pointers here are saved as 64-bit values because this
    structure may be passed from a 32-bit boot manager to a 64-bit OS loader.

Members:

    Version - Stores the version number of the loader initialization block.
        Set to BOOT_INITIALIZATION_BLOCK_VERSION.

    BootConfigurationFileSize - Stores the size of the boot configuration file
        buffer in bytes.

    BootConfigurationFile - Stores a pointer to a buffer containing the
        contents of the boot configuration file.

    BootEntryFlags - Stores the flags associated with this boot entry. See
        BOOT_ENTRY_FLAG_* definitions.

    BootEntryId - Stores the identifier of the selected boot entry.

    ReservedRegionCount - Stores the number of reserved region structures in
        the array.

    ReservedRegions - Stores a pointer to an array of reserved regions of
        memeory that may or may not be in the firmware memory map. This array
        is of type BOOT_RESERVED_REGION.

    StackTop - Stores a pointer to the top of the stack.

    StackSize - Stores the size of the boot stack region, in bytes.

    EfiImageHandle - Stores a pointer to the EFI image handle used to launch
        the boot application that launched this boot application. Note the
        type here is an EFI_HANDLE *, not an EFI_HANDLE.

    EfiSystemTable - Stores a pointer to the EFI system table as passed to the
        original EFI boot application. The type here is an EFI_SYSTEM_TABLE *.

    PartitionOffset - Stores the offset in blocks from the beginning of the
        disk to the OS partition if the firmware doesn't support partitions
        natively.

    ApplicationName - Stores a pointer to a string containing the file name of
        the application being launched.

    ApplicationLowestAddress - Stores the lowest address of the boot
        application image.

    ApplicationSize - Stores the size of the loaded boot application image in
        bytes.

    ApplicationArguments - Stores a pointer to a null terminated string
        containing the command-line-esque arguments to the application.

    PageDirectory - Stores the address of the top level page table in use.

    DriveNumber - Stores the drive number of the OS partition for legacy PC/AT
        systems.

    Flags - Stores flags describing the environment state. See
        BOOT_INITIALIZATION_FLAG_* definitions.

Structure Description:

    This structure stores information needed by the kernel to initialize. It
    is provided by the loader when the kernel is launched.

Members:

    Version - Stores the version number of the loader block. This is used to
        detect version mismatch between the loader and the kernel.

    Size - Stores the total size of the initialization block structure, in
        bytes. This field can also be used to detect mismatch or corruption
        between the loader and the kernel.

    FirmwareTables - Stores a pointer to the directory of static tables
        provided by the platform firmware.

    MemoryMap - Stores a pointer to the memory map of the machine, including
        any regions defined by the firmware, and regions allocated by the
        loader.

    VirtualMap - Stores a pointer to the virtual memory map created for the
        kernel.

    PageDirectory - Stores a pointer to the top level paging structure.

    PageTables - Stores a pointer to the page tables.

    PageTableStage - Stores a pointer to the initial page table staging area.
        The mapping for this virtual does *not* correspond to any valid memory,
        but a page table has been set up for this VA to prevent infinite loops.

    MmInitMemory - Stores a buffer of memory that the memory manager can use
        to initialize itself. This memory is mapped as loader permanent.

    ImageList - Stores the head of the list of images loaded by the kernel.
        Entries on this list are of type LOADED_IMAGE.

    KernelModule - Stores a pointer to the module information for the kernel
        itself. This data should also be in the loaded modules list.

    LoaderModule - Stores a pointer to the module information for the OS
        loader. This data should also be in the loaded modules list.

    KernelStack - Stores the kernel stack buffer that processor 0 should use.

    DeviceToDriverFile - Stores the location of the file containing the mapping
        between devices and drivers.

    DeviceMapFile - Stores the location of the file containing a list of
        unenumerable devices that exist on the system.

    SystemResourceListHead - Stores the list of system resources provided to
        the kernel by the loader. All system resources begin with a
        SYSTEM_RESOURCE_HEADER.

    BootEntry - Stores a pointer to the boot entry that was launched.

    BootTime - Stores the boot time of the system.

    FirmwareType - Stores the system firmware type.

    EfiRuntimeServices - Stores a pointer to the EFI runtime services table.
        This is only valid on EFI based systems.

    CycleCounterFrequency - Stores an estimate of the frequency of the cycle
        counter, used for very early stall services. On some architectures or
        platforms this may be 0.
