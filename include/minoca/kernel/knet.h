Enumeration Description:

    This enumeration describes the various socket options for the basic socket
    information class.

Values:

    SocketBasicOptionInvalid - Indicates an invalid basic socket option.

    SocketBasicOptionAcceptConnections - Indicates that the listening state of
        the socket should be retrieved. This option is read only and takes a
        ULONG boolean.

    SocketBasicOptionBroadcastEnabled - Indicates that the sending of broadcast
        packets should be enabled or disabled, or that the current state of the
        ability to send broadcast packets should be retrieved. This option
        takes a ULONG boolean.

    SocketBasicOptionDebug - Indicates that debugging should be enabled or
        disabled for the socket, or that the current debug state should be
        retrieved. This option takes a ULONG boolean.

    SocketBasicOptionRoutingDisabled - Indicates that the default routing
        process for packets should be enabled or disabled, or retrieves whether
        or not default routing is disabled. This option takes a ULONG boolean.

    SocketBasicOptionErrorStatus - Indicates that the socket's error status
        should be retrieved and cleared. This option is read only and takes a
        KSTATUS.

    SocketBasicOptionKeepAlive - Indicates that the performance of periodic
        connection checks should be enabled or disabled, or that the state of
        the use of such checks should be retrieved. This option takes a ULONG
        boolean.

    SocketBasicOptionLinger - Indicates that the socket's linger state should
        be modified or retrieved. This option takes a SOCKET_LINGER structure.
        If disabled, a connected socket will return immediately from a close
        operation and attempt to gracefully shut down the connection. If
        enabled without a timeout, a connected socket will abort the connection
        on a close option. If enabled with a timeout, the close operation will
        not return until all data has been sent and a graceful shutdown is
        complete or until the timer has expired, at which point the connection
        will be aborted.

    SocketBasicOptionInlineOutOfBand - Indicates that the inclusion of urgent
        data in the mainline packet processing should be enabled or disabled,
        or retrieves the current state of urgent packet processing. This option
        takes a ULONG boolean.

    SocketBasicOptionReceiveBufferSize - Indicates the size of the socket's
        receive bufffer to set, in bytes, or retrieves the current size of the
        socket's receive buffer. This option takes a ULONG.

    SocketBasicOptionReceiveMinimum - Indicates the minimum amount of data, in
        bytes, that needs to be received before the system will alert any
        readers that may be waiting on poll or receive operations. This option
        takes a ULONG.

    SocketBasicOptionReceiveTimeout - Indicates the maximum amount of time, in
        milliseconds, that a receive operation should wait for more data before
        completing. This option takes a SOCKET_TIME structure.

    SocketBasicOptionSendBufferSize - Indicates the size of the socket's send
        buffer to set, in bytes, or retrieves the current size of the socket's
        send buffer, in bytes. This option takes a ULONG.

    SocketBasicOptionSendMinimum - Indicates the minimum amount of data, in
        bytes, that needs to be sent before the socket will actually transmit
        packets. This option takes a ULONG.

    SocketBasicOptionSendTimeout - Indicates the maximum amount of time, in
        milliseconds, that a send operation should wait to send data if it is
        blocked by flow control. This option takes a SOCKET_TIME structure.

    SocketBasicOptionType - Indicates that the socket's protocol should be
        retrieved. This option is read only and takes a ULONG.

    SocketBasicOptionReuseAnyAddress - Indicates that the socket may be bound
        to the same local port as an existing socket as long as one of them is
        bound to the any address and the other is bound to a different local
        address (i.e. not the any address). Both sockets must have this option
        set for it to take effect. This option takes a ULONG Boolean. As a
        hold-over from the BSD sockets implementation, this will also set the
        SocketBasicOptionReuseTimeWait option.

    SocketBasicOptionReuseExactAddress - Indicates that the sockets may bind to
        the exact same address and port as an existing socket. Both sockets
        must have this option enabled. This option takes a ULONG boolean.

    SocketBasicOptionPassCredentials - Indicates that credentials should be
        sent and received automatically with messages on the socket. This is
        only applicable for local sockets. This option takes a ULONG boolean.

    SocketBasicOptionPeerCredentials - Indicates the credentials of the
        foreign socket at the time of connect. This is only applicable for
        local sockets.

    SocketBasicOptionDomain - Indicates that the socket's domain should be
        retrieved. This option is read only and takes a NET_DOMAIN_TYPE
        structure.

    SocketBasicOptionLocalAddress - Indicates that the socket's local address
        should be retrieved. This option is read only and takes a
        NETWORK_ADDRESS structure.

    SocketBasicOptionRemoteAddress - Indicates that the socket's remote address
        should be retrieved. This option is read only and takes a
        NETWORK_ADDRESS structure.

    SocketBasicOptionReuseTimeWait - Indicates that the socket may be bound to
        the exact same local address and port as an existing socket as long as
        the existing socket is in the time-wait state. Both sockets must have
        this option set for it to take effect. This option takes a ULONG
        boolean.
