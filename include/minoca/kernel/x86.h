Structure Description:

    This structure defines the format of a task, interrupt, or call gate
    descriptor. This structure must not be padded, since the hardware relies on
    this exact format.

Members:

    LowOffset - Stores the lower 16 bits of the gate's destination address.

    Selector - Stores the code segment selector the gate code should run in.

    Count - Must be 0 for entries in the IDT.

    Access - Stores various properties of the gate.
        Bit 7: Present. 1 if the gate is present, 0 if not present.
        Bits 6-5: DPL. Sets the ring number this handler executes in. Zero is
            the most privileged ring, 3 is least privileged.
        Bit 4: Reserved (set to 0).
        Bits 3-0: The gate type. Set to CALL_GATE_TYPE, INTERRUPT_GATE_TYPE,
            TASK_GATE_TYPE, or TRAP_GATE_TYPE.

    HighOffset - Stores the upper 16 bits of the interrupt handler's address.

Structure Description:

    This structure define a Global Descriptor Table entry. The GDT table sets
    up the segmentation features of the processor and privilege levels.

Members:

    LimitLow - Stores the lower 16 bits of the descriptor limit.

    BaseLow - Stores the lower 16 bits of the descriptor base.

    BaseMiddle - Stores the next 8 bits of the base.

    Access - Stores the access flags. The access byte has the following format:

             |  P  |    DPL    |  S  |         Type          |

             P - Is segment present (1 = Yes)

             DPL - Descriptor privilege level: Ring 0-3. Zero is the highest
                   privilege, 3 is the lowest (least privileged).

             S - System flag. Set to 0 if it's a system segment, or 1 if it's a
                 code/data segment.

             Type - Segment type: code segment / data segment. The Type field
                has the following definition:

                Bit 3 - Set to 1 for Code, or 0 for Data.

                Bit 2 - Expansion direction. Set to 0 for expand-up, or 1 for
                    expand-down.

                Bit 1 - Write-Enable. Set to 0 for Read Only, or 1 for
                    Read/Write.

                Bit 0 - Accessed. This bit is set by the processor when memory
                    in this segment is accessed. It is never cleared by
                    hardware.

    Granularity - Stores the granularity for the descriptor. The granularity
        byte has the following format:

             |  7  |  6  |  5  |  4  |  3  |  2  |  1  |  0  |

             |  G  |  D  |  L  |  A  | Segment length 19:16  |

             G - Granularity. 0 = 1 byte, 1 = 1 KByte.

             D - Operand Size. 0 = 16/64 bit, 1 = 32 bit.

             L - Long mode (64 bit).

             A - Available for system use (always zero).

    BaseHigh - Stores the high 8 bits of the base address.

    WriteThrough - Stores whether or not write-through caching is enabled (1)
        or write-back caching (0).

    CacheDisabled - Stores whether or not to use caching. If this bit is set,
        the page will not be cached.

    Accessed - Stores whether or not the page has been accessed. This bit is
        set automatically by the processor, but will never be cleared by the
        processor.

    Dirty - Stores whether or not this page has been written to. This bit is
        set automatically by the processor, but must be cleared by software.

    LargePage - Stores whether or not large 4MB pages are in use (1) or 4kB
        pages (0).

    Global - Stores whether or not the TLB should avoid flushing this address
        if CR3 is changed. If this bit is set, then the TLB entry for this page
        will not be invalidated when CR3 is reset.

/*++

Structure Description:

    This structure contains the state of the processor, including both the
    non-volatile general registers and the system registers configured by the
    kernel. This structure is used in a manner similar to the C library
    setjmp/longjmp routines, the save context function appears to return
    twice. It returns once after the saving is complete, and then again with
    a different return value after restoring. Be careful when modifying this
    structure, as its offsets are used directly in assembly by the save/restore
    routines.

Members:

    Eax - Stores the value to return when restoring.

    Eip - Stores the instruction pointer to jump back to on restore. By default
        this is initialized to the return from whoever called save.

    Cs - Stores the code segment.

    Eflags - Stores the eflags register.

    Ebx - Stores a non-volatile general register.

    Esi - Stores a non-volatile general register.

    Edi - Stores a non-volatile general register.

    Ebp - Stores a non-volatile general register.

    Esp - Stores the stack pointer. This should be restored after the final
        page tables are in place to avoid NMIs having an invalid stack.

    Dr7 - Stores a debug register. This should be restored last of the debug
        registers.

    Dr6 - Stores a debug register.

    Dr0 - Stores a debug register.

    Dr1 - Stores a debug register.

    Dr2 - Stores a debug register.

    Dr3 - Stores a debug register.

    VirtualAddress - Stores the virtual address of this structure member, which
        is used in case the restore of CR0 that just happened enabled paging
        suddenly.

    Cr0 - Stores the CR0 control register value.

    Cr2 - Stores the CR2 control register value (faulting address).

    Cr3 - Stores the CR3 control register value (top level page directory).

    Cr4 - Stores the CR4 control register value.

    Tr - Stores the task register (must be restored after the GDT).

    Idt - Stores the interrupt descriptor table. The stack should be restored
        before this because once this is restored NMIs could come in and use
        stack (rather than the stub function they may currently be on).

    Gdt - Stores the global descriptor table.

ULONGLONG
ArReadTimeStampCounter (

/*++

Routine Description:

    This routine reads the time stamp counter from the current processor. It
    is essential that callers of this function understand that this returns
    instruction cycles, which does not always translate directly into units
    of time. For example, some processors halt the timestamp counter during
    performance and CPU idle state transitions. In other cases, the timestamp
    counters of all processors are not in sync, so as execution of a thread
    bounces unpredictably from one core to another, different timelines may be
    observed. Additionally, one must understand that this intrinsic is not a
    serializing instruction to the hardware, so the processor may decide to
    execute any number of instructions after this one before actually snapping
    the timestamp counter. To all those who choose to continue to use this
    primitive to measure time, you have been warned.

Arguments:

    None.

Return Value:

    Returns the current instruction cycle count since the processor was started.
