Abstract:

    This header contains definitions for external hardware modules. These are
    not drivers, but rather pieces of hardware core to the basic operation of
    the kernel, including timers, interrupt controllers, DMA controllers, and
    debug devices.

Structure Description:

    This structure is used to describe a cache controller timer to the system.
    It is passed from the hardware module to the kernel.

Members:

    TableVersion - Stores the version of the cache controller description table
        as understood by the hardware module. Set this to
        CACHE_CONTROLLER_DESCRIPTION_VERSION.

    FunctionTable - Stores the table of pointers to the hardware module's
        functions.

    Context - Stores a pointer's worth of data specific to this cache
        controller instance. This pointer will be passed back to the hardware
        module on each call.

    Identifier - Stores the unique identifier of the cache controller.

    PropertiesVersion - Stores the version of the cache controller properties
        as understood by the hardware module. Set this to

Routine Description:

    This routine allocates memory from the non-paged pool. This memory will
    never be paged out and can be accessed at any level.

Arguments:

    Size - Supplies the size of the allocation, in bytes.

    Tag - Supplies an identifier to associate with the allocation, useful for
        debugging and leak detection.

    Device - Supplies a boolean indicating if this memory will be accessed by

Arguments:

    PhysicalAddress - Supplies a pointer to the physical address. This address
        must be page aligned.

    SizeInBytes - Supplies the size in bytes of the mapping. This will be
        rounded up to the nearest page size.

    CacheDisabled - Supplies a boolean indicating if the memory is to be mapped

    when configuring devices that can remap their memory windows. This function
    should be called during the discovery portion, as it is relevant to the
    system regardless of whether that hardware module is actually initialized
    and used.

Arguments:
