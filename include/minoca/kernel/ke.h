Structure Description:

Members:

        memory address when the structure is retrieved through unconventional
        means (like a segment register).

    ProcessorNumber - Stores the zero-based logical processor number.

    RunLevel - Stores the current run level of the processor.

    Tss - Stores a pointer to the current Task Segment for this processor. This
        only applies to PC processors. This member is accessed directly by
        assembly code, so its offset must be manually maintained.

    Gdt - Stores a pointer to the GDT for this processor. This only applies to
        PC processors. This member is accessed directly by assembly code, so
        its offset should be manually maintained.

    RunningThread - Stores the current thread scheduled on this processor.

    PreviousThread - Stores a pointer to the thread that was just scheduled
        out, but has yet to be put back on the ready list.

    Scheduler - Stores the scheduler context for this processor.

    Idt - Stores a pointer to the Interrupt Descriptor Table.

        minimum vector.

    IpiListHead - Stores the list head for IPI request packets.

    IpiListLock - Stores the lock protecting access to the IPI list.

    PendingInterruptCount - Stores the number of interrupts that are currently
        queued to be replayed.

    PendingInterrupts - Stores the queue of interrupts that need to be
        replayed. This array is the size of the number of hardware levels that
        exist, and will always be sorted. It requires that interrupt
        controllers never allow interrupts to get through that are less than
        or equal to the priority of the current interrupt in service.

    PendingDispatchInterrupt - Stores a boolean indicating whether or not a
        dispatch level software interrupt is pending.

    DpcInProgress - Stores a pointer to the currently executing DPC.

    DpcLock - Stores the spin lock protecting the DPC list.

    DpcList - Stores the list head of DPCs pending on this processor.

        processor.

    TimerData - Stores a pointer to the timer management context.

    ClockInterruptCount - Stores the number of clock interrupts for this
        processor.

Structure Description:

    This structure defines the contents of the user shared data page, which is
    shared between kernel mode and user mode.

Members:

    EncodedSystemVersion - Stores the encoded system version information.

    SystemVersionSerial - Stores the serial system revision.

    BuildTime - Stores the system build time (the seconds portion of a system
        time structure).

    TimeCounterFrequency - Stores the frequency of the time counter. This value
        won't change once the system is booted.

    ProcessorCounterFrequency - Stores the frequency of the processor counter
        on the boot processor. This is roughly related to the processor speed,
        but not exactly. For example, on ARM, it may the the processor speed
        divided by 64.

    TimeOffset - Stores the system time when the time counter was zero.

    TimeCounter - Stores the number of ticks since the system was started. This
        value is periodically updated and serves only as a reasonable
        approximation of the current time counter.

    SystemTime - Stores the current system time.

    TickCount - Stores the number of clock interrupts that have occurred since
        the system started. Clock interrupts do not necessarily occur at the
        same interval and thus cannot be used to accurately measure time. This
        member is incremented each time the time counter and system time
        members are updated, so it can be used to detect torn reads.

    TickCount2 - Stores a copy of the tick count value, updated after all the
        other time members are updated (with a memory barrier in between the
        updates of all other time variables and this one).

    CurrentTimeZoneDataSize - Stores the size in bytes needed to get the
        current system time zone data.

    ProcessorFeatures - Stores a bitfield of architecture-specific feature

/*++

Routine Description:

    This routine configures and queues a timer object. The timer must not
    already be queued, otherwise the system will crash. This routine must be
    called at or below dispatch level.

Arguments:

    Timer - Supplies a pointer to the timer to configure and queue.

    QueueType - Supplies the queue the timer should reside on. Valid values are:

        TimerQueueSoft - The timer will be expired at the first applicable
            clock interrupt, but a clock interrupt will not be scheduled solely
            for this timer. This timer type has the best power management
            profile, but may cause the expiration of the timer to be fairly
            late, as the system will not come out of idle to service this timer.
            The DPC for this timer may run on any processor.

        TimerQueueSoftWake - The timer will be expired at the first applicable
            clock interrupt. If the system was otherwise idle, a clock
            interrupt will be scheduled for this timer. This is a balanced
            choice for timers that can have some slack in their expiration, but
            need to run approximately when scheduled, even if the system is
            idle. The DPC will run on the processor where the timer was queued.

        TimerQueueHard - A clock interrupt will be scheduled for exactly the
            specified deadline. This is the best choice for high performance
            timers that need to expire as close to their deadlines as possible.
            It is the most taxing on power management, as it pulls the system
            out of idle, schedules an extra clock interrupt, and requires
            programming hardware. The DPC will run on the processor where the
            timer was queued.

    DueTime - Supplies the value of the time tick counter when this timer
        should expire (an absolute value in time counter ticks). If this value
        is 0, then an automatic due time of the current time plus the given
        period will be computed.

    Period - Supplies an optional period, in time counter ticks, for periodic
        timers. If this value is non-zero, the period will be added to the
        original due time and the timer will be automatically rearmed.

    Flags - Supplies an optional bitfield of flags. See KTIMER_FLAG_*
        definitions.

    Dpc - Supplies an optional pointer to a DPC that will be queued when this
        timer expires.
