/*++

Routine Description:

    This routine allocates memory from a kernel pool.

Arguments:

    PoolType - Supplies the type of pool to allocate from. Valid choices are:

        PoolTypeNonPaged - This type of memory will never be paged out. It is a
        scarce resource, and should only be allocated if paged pool is not
        an option. This memory is marked no-execute.

        PoolTypePaged - This is normal memory that may be transparently paged if
        memory gets tight. The caller may not touch paged pool at run-levels at
        or above dispatch, and is not suitable for DMA (as its physical address
        may change unexpectedly.) This pool type should be used for most normal
        allocations. This memory is marked no-execute.

    Size - Supplies the size of the allocation, in bytes.

    Tag - Supplies an identifier to associate with the allocation, useful for
        debugging and leak detection.

Return Value:

    Returns the allocated memory if successful, or NULL on failure.

Routine Description:

    This routine resizes the given allocation, potentially creating a new
    buffer and copying the old contents in.

Arguments:

    PoolType - Supplies the type of pool the memory was allocated from. This
        must agree with the type of pool the allocation originated from, or
        the system will become unstable.

    Memory - Supplies the original active allocation. If this parameter is
        NULL, this routine will simply allocate memory.

    NewSize - Supplies the new required size of the allocation. If this is
        0, then the original allocation will simply be freed.

    AllocationTag - Supplies an identifier for this allocation.

Return Value:

    Returns a pointer to a buffer with the new size (and original contents) on
    success. This may be a new buffer or the same one.

    FileOffset - Supplies the offset, in bytes, from the start of the file
        where the mapping should begin.

    VaRequest - Supplies a pointer to the virtual address allocation
        parameters. If the supplied size is zero, then this routine will
        attempt to map until the end of the file. The alignment will be set
        to a page size, and the memory type will be set to reserved.

    Flags - Supplies flags governing the mapping of the section. See
        IMAGE_SECTION_* definitions.

    KernelSpace - Supplies a boolean indicating whether to map the section in
        kernel space or user space.

    Reservation - Supplies an optional pointer to a memory reservation for the
        desired mapping. A reservation is required only if several mappings
        need to be allocated in the same range together for any one mapping to
        be useful.

Return Value:

    Status code.
