    PNETWORK_ADDRESS FirstAddress,

    );

/*++

Routine Description:

    This routine compares two network addresses.

Arguments:

    FirstAddress - Supplies a pointer to the left side of the comparison.

    SecondAddress - Supplies a pointer to the second side of the comparison.

Return Value:

    Same if the two nodes have the same value.

    Ascending if the first node is less than the second node.

    Descending if the second node is less than the first node.

/*++

Routine Description:

    This routine allocates a network buffer.

Arguments:

    HeaderSize - Supplies the number of header bytes needed.

    Size - Supplies the number of data bytes needed.

    FooterSize - Supplies the number of footer bytes needed.

    Link - Supplies a pointer to the link the buffer will be sent through. If
        a link is provided, then the buffer will be backed by physically
        contiguous pages for the link's hardware. If no link is provided, then
        the buffer will not be backed by physically contiguous pages.

    Flags - Supplies a bitmask of allocation flags. See
        NET_ALLOCATE_BUFFER_FLAG_* for definitions.

    NewBuffer - Supplies a pointer where a pointer to the new allocation will be
        returned on success.

Return Value:

    STATUS_SUCCESS on success.

    STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER if a zero length buffer was requested.

    STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES if the buffer or any auxiliary structures
        could not be allocated.

Arguments:

    BufferList - Supplies a pointer to the buffer list to be destroyed.

Return Value:

/*++

Routine Description:

    This routine determines if the given ethernet address is a valid individual
    address or not. This routine returns FALSE for 00:00:00:00:00:00 and
    FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF, and TRUE for everything else.

Arguments:

    Address - Supplies the address to check.

Return Value:

    TRUE if the ethernet address is a valid individual address.

    FALSE if the address is not valid.

Routine Description:

    This routine generates a random ethernet address.

Arguments:
