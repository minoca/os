#   Module Name:
#
#       C Library
#
#   Abstract:
#
#       This module contains the C library, which provides a largely standard
#       interface between applications and the kernel interface. This C library
#       is considered "mostly POSIX". It attempts to follow the POSIX standard
#       as closely as possible, but adds many extensions expected by mainstream
#       programs, and omits some of the darker corners of the specification.
