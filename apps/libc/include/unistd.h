Routine Description:

    This routine sets the current program break to the specified address.

    New programs should use malloc and free in favor of this deprecated
    legacy function. This function is likely to fail if any other memory
    functions such as malloc or free are used. Other functions, including the
    C library, may use malloc and free silently. This function is neither
    thread-safe nor reentrant.

Arguments:

    parameters to this function also include the environment variables to use.

Arguments:

    Path - Supplies a pointer to a string containing the fully specified path
        of the file to execute.

    Argument0 - Supplies the first argument to the program, usually the same
        as the program name.

    ... - Supplies the arguments to the program. The argument list must be
        terminated with a NULL. After the NULL an array of strings representing
        the environment is expected (think of it like a final argument after
        the NULL in the form const char *envp[]).

Return Value:

    Does not return on success, the current process is gutted and replaced with
    the specified image.

    -1 on error, and the errno variable will be set to contain more information.

Arguments:

    Path - Supplies the path string of the file to get the accessibility
        information for.

    Mode - Supplies the mode bits the caller is interested in. Valid values are
        F_OK to check if the file exists, R_OK to check if the file is readable,
        W_OK to check if the file is writable, and X_OK to check if the file is
        executable.

Return Value:

    0 on success.

    -1 on failure and the errno variable will be set to provide more
    information.

Routine Description:

    This routine checks the given path for accessibility using the real user
    ID and real group ID rather than the effective user and group IDs.

Arguments:

    Directory - Supplies an optional file descriptor. If the given path
        is a relative path, the directory referenced by this descriptor will
        be used as a starting point for path resolution. Supply AT_FDCWD to
        use the working directory for relative paths.

    Path - Supplies the path string of the file to get the accessibility
        information for.

    Mode - Supplies the mode bits the caller is interested in. Valid values are
        F_OK to check if the file exists, R_OK to check if the file is readable,
        W_OK to check if the file is writable, and X_OK to check if the file is
        executable.

    Flags - Supplies a bitfield of flags. Supply AT_EACCESS if the checks for
        accessibility should be performed using the effective user and group
        ID rather than the real user and group ID.

Return Value:

    0 on success.

        with the source buffer).

    ByteCount - Supplies the number of bytes to copy. This should be even. If

Arguments:

    Key - Supplies the key, a user's plaintext password.

    Salt - Supplies a two character salt to use to perterb the results. If this
        string starts with a $ and a number, alternate hashing algorithms are
        selected. The format is $id$salt$encrypted. ID can be 1 for MD5, 5 for
        SHA-256, or 6 for SHA-512.

Return Value:

/*++

Routine Description:

    This routine parses command line arguments, successively returning each
    passed in argument. This routine is neither reentrant nor thread safe.

Arguments:

    ArgumentCount - Supplies the argument count from main.

    Arguments - Supplies the argument array from main.

    Options - Supplies a pointer to a null terminated string containing the set
        of accepted options. Each character represents an allowed option. If
        a character is followed by a colon ':', then that option takes an
        argument. If an option with an argument is found and there are more
        characters in the current string, then the remainder of that string
        will be returned. Otherwise, the next argument will be returned. If
        there is no next argument, that's considered an error.

Return Value:

    Returns the next option character on success. The global variable optind
    will be updated to reflect the index of the next argument to be processed.
    It will be initialied by the system to 1. If the option takes an argument,
    the global variable optarg will be set to point at that argument.

    Returns '?' if the option found is not in the recognized option string. The
    optopt global variable will be set to the unrecognized option that resulted
    in this condition. The '?' character is also returned if the options string
    does not begin with a colon ':' and a required argument is not found. If the
    opterr global variable has not been set to 0 by the user, then an error
    will be printed to standard error.

    Returns ':' if the options string begins with a colon and a required
    argument is missing. If the opterr global variable has not been set to 0 by
    the user, then an error will be printed to standard error.

    -1 if a non-option was encountered. In this case the optind global variable
    will be set to the first non-option argument.
