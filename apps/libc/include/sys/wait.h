// Use this to get the exit status out of a child process.

#define WEXITSTATUS(_Status) (((_Status) & 0x0000FF00) >> 8)

//
// This macro evaluates to nonzero if the status indicates that the child has
// exited due to an uncaught signal. This constant matches up to flags in
// ksignals.h. The macro is looking to make sure that the lower 7 bits are not
// all 0 (exited) and are not all 1 (continued or stopped).

// This macro evaluates to nonzero if the status indicates that the child has

// This macro returns the stop signal if the child was stopped.

/*++

Routine Description:

    This routine obtains status information about one of the caller's
    terminated child processes. This routine blocks until such status
    information becomes available or until the calling process receives a
    terminating signal.

Arguments:

    Status - Supplies an optional pointer where the child process' exit status
        information will be returned.

Return Value:

    Returns the process ID of the child process that just experienced a state
    change.

    -1 on failure, and the errno variable will contain more information.

waitpid (
    pid_t ProcessId,
    int *Status,
    int Options
    );

/*++

Routine Description:

    This routine obtains status information about one of the caller's child
    processes. This routine can block waiting for any child process to change,
    or can wait for a specific process.

Arguments:

    ProcessId - Supplies the process ID of the process to wait for. The
        various valid values are as follows:

        If equal to -1, then this routine will be equivalent to the original
            routine, it will return when any process has status information.

        If greater than 0, then the specific process ID will be waited for.

        If 0, then any child whose process process group ID is equal to that of
            the calling process will satisfy the wait.

        If less than negative one, then any child process whose process group ID
            is equal to the absolute value of this parameter will satisfy the
            wait.

    Status - Supplies an optional pointer where the child process' exit status
        information will be returned.

    Options - Supplies a bitfield of options. This field may contain one or
        more of the following options:

        WCONTINUED - Wait for a process that just continued.

        WNOHANG - Return immediately if no child process information is
            currently available.

        WUNTRACED - Wait for a process that just stopped.

Return Value:

    Returns the process ID of the child process that just experienced a state
    change.

    -1 on failure, and the errno variable will contain more information.

waitid (
    idtype_t IdentifierType,
    id_t ProcessOrGroupIdentifier,
    siginfo_t *SignalInformation,
    int Options
    );

/*++

Routine Description:

    This routine suspends execution until a child process of this process
    changes state.

Arguments:

    IdentifierType - Supplies a value indicating whether the process or group
        identifier identifies a process, group, or nothing. If nothing, then
        any child process changing state will satisfy the wait.

    ProcessOrGroupIdentifier - Supplies a process or process group identifier
        to wait for. If the identifier type indicates neither, then this
        parameter is ignored.

    SignalInformation - Supplies a pointer where the child signal information
        will be returned.

    Options - Supplies a bitfield of options. Valid values are WEXITED,
        WSTOPPED, WCONTINUED, WNOHANG, and WNOWAIT. One or more of WEXITED,
        WSTOPPED or WCONTINUED must be supplied.

Return Value:

    0 if WNOHANG was specified and no child was waiting to report status
    information.

    0 on success (child information was returned).

    -1 on failure, and the errno variable will be set to indicate the error.

/*++

Routine Description:

    This routine is equivalent to the wait function, except it can obtain
    resource usage about the reaped child. This function is provided for
    compatibility with existing applications. New applications should use the
    waitpid function.

Arguments:

    Status - Supplies an optional pointer where the child process' exit status
        information will be returned.

    Options - Supplies a bitfield of options. See the waitpid function for
        more details.

    ResourceUsage - Supplies an optional pointer where the resource usage of
        the process will be returned on success.

Return Value:

    Returns the process ID of the child process that just experienced a state
    change.

    -1 on failure, and the errno variable will contain more information.
