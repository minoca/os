Arguments:

    MultibyteCharacter - Supplies an optional pointer to the buffer where the

Routine Description:

    This routine breaks a wide string into a series of tokens delimited by any
    character from the given separator set. The first call passes an input
    string in. This routine scans looking for a non-separator character, which
    marks the first token. It then scans looking for a separator character, and
    sets that byte to the null terminator to delimit the first character.
    Subsequent calls should pass NULL as the input string, and the context
    pointer will be updated so that successive calls return the next tokens.
    This routine is thread safe and re-entrant so long as the same context
    pointer is not used by multiple threads.

Arguments:

    InputString - Supplies a pointer to the wide input string to tokenize. If
        supplied, this will reset the value returned in the last token context
        pointer.

    Separators - Supplies a pointer to a null terminated wide string containing
        the set of characters that delimit tokens. This may vary from call to
        call of this routine with the same context pointer.

    LastToken - Supplies a pointer where a context pointer will be stored
        allowing this routine to keep its place and return successive tokens.

Return Value:

    Returns a pointer to the next token on success.

    NULL if there are no more tokens.

Routine Description:

    This routine transforms the given input string in such a way that using

    once rather than on each strcoll comparison.

Arguments:

    Result - Supplies an optional pointer where the transformed string will be
        returned. This can be NULL to just get the size of the transformed
        string.

    Input - Supplies a pointer to the string to transform according to the
        current value of LC_COLLATE.

    ResultSize - Supplies the size of the result buffer in bytes. This routine
        will not write more than this number of bytes to the result buffer.

    supplied or is too small) not including the null terminator byte.

    Buffer - Supplies a pointer where the converted wide string will be

    BufferSize - Supplies the size of the string buffer in characters.

    Format - Supplies the wide format string to govern the conversion. Ordinary
        characters in the format string will be copied verbatim to the output
        string. Conversions will be substituted for their corresponding value
        in the provided calendar time. The conversions follow the same format
        as the non-wide print time function.

    Time - Supplies a pointer to the calendar time value to use in the
