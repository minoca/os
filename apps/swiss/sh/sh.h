/*++

Routine Description:

    This routine performs pathname expansion on the fields in the given field
    array.

Arguments:

    Shell - Supplies a pointer to the shell.

    StringBuffer - Supplies a pointer where the address of the fields string
        buffer is on input. On output, this may contain a different buffer that
        all the fields point into.

    StringBufferSize - Supplies a pointer that contains the size of the fields
        string buffer. This value will be updated to reflect the new size.

    FieldArray - Supplies a pointer to the array of string pointers of the
        fields on input. This array may get replaced if more elements need to
        be added for paths.

    FieldArrayCount - Supplies a pointer that contains the number of field
        elements on input. This value will be updated to reflect the number of
        fields after pathname expansion.

Return Value:

    TRUE on success.

        will be returned on success. If this is not the same pointer as the
        command string then the caller is responsible for freeing this buffer.

    FullCommandSize - Supplies a pointer where the size of the full command
        string will be returned.

    ReturnValue - Supplies a pointer where a premature return value will be
        returned. If this is not zero, then it contains the value that should
        be returned without trying to execute the command. On success, this
        variable will not be touched.

Return Value:

    TRUE on success.
