Structure Description:

    This structure stores the main file header for an ELF image. It is located
    at offset 0 in the file and stores the locations of other ELF headers.

Members:

    Identification - Stores a magic number identifying the file as an ELF file,
        as well as several other pieces of information such as the file version,
        ELF version, endianness, etc.

    ImageType - Stores the type of file this is (relocatable, executable,
        shared object, etc.)

    Machine - Stores the machine architecture of the code in this image.

    Version - Stores the version of the ELF format.

    EntryPoint - Stores the virtual address where the system should transfer
        control to once the image is loaded.

    ProgramHeaderOffset - Stores the offset within the file to the first
        program header.

    SectionHeaderOffset - Stores the offset within the file to the first
        section header.

    Flags - Stores processor-specific flags associated with the file.

    ElfHeaderSize - Stores the size of this header, in bytes.

    ProgramHeaderSize - Stores the size of one program header, in bytes.

    ProgramHeaderCount - Stores the number of program headers in the file.

    SectionHeaderSize - Stores the size of one section header, in bytes.

    SectionHeaderCount - Stores the number of section headers in the file.

    StringSectionIndex - Stores the section header table index of the entry
        associated with the section name string table.

Structure Description:

    This structure stores information about a section of data in an ELF32 file.

Members:

    NameOffset - Stores the index into the string table section, giving the
        location of a null-terminated string of the name of the section.

    Type - Stores a description of the section's contents and semantics. See
        the ELF_SECTION_TYPE_* definitions.

    Flags - Stores miscellaneous attributes of the section. See the
        ELF_SECTION_FLAG_* definitions.

    VirtualAddress - Stores the virtual address of the beginning of this
        section.

    Offset - Stores the byte offset from the beginning of the file to the first
        byte in the section. If the section type is NOBITS, and this field
        locates the conceptual placement in the file.

    Size - Stores the size of the section in bytes both in memory an on disk
        (unless the type is NOBITS, in which case the file contains no bytes).

    Link - Stores a section header table index link, whose interpretation
        depends on the section type.

    Information - Stores extra information, whose interpretation depends on the
        section type.

    Alignment - Stores the alignment constraints of the section. Only 0 and
        positive powers of 2 are supported. Values of 0 or 1 indicate no
        alignment constraints.

    EntrySize - Stores the size of one entry, if the section holds a table of
        fixed size entries, such as a symbol table. This field contains 0 if
        the section does not hold a table of fixed size entries.

    multiple sections.

Members:

    Type - Stores what type of segment this array element describes. See
        ELF_SEGMENT_TYPE_* definitions.

    Offset - Stores the offset from the beginning of the file, in bytes, at
        which the first byte of the segment resides.

    VirtualAddress - Stores the virtual address at which the first byte of the
        segment resides in memory.

    PhysicalAddress - Stores the physical address at which the segment resides.
        This field is almost always the same as the virtual address.

    FileSize - Stores the number of bytes in the file image of the segment. It
        may be zero.

    MemorySize - Stores the number of bytes in the memory image of the segment.
        It may be zero.

    Flags - Stores flags regarding this segment. See ELF_PROGRAM_HEADER_FLAG_*
        definitions.

    Alignment - Stores the power of two alignment requirement for the segment.
        Values of 0 and 1 mean that no alignment is required.

Structure Description:

    This structure stores information about a program segment, used to load
    ELF64 files. Segments are distinct from sections. One segment may contain
    multiple sections.

Members:

    Type - Stores what type of segment this array element describes. See
        ELF_SEGMENT_TYPE_* definitions.

    Flags - Stores flags regarding this segment. See ELF_PROGRAM_HEADER_FLAG_*
        definitions.

    Offset - Stores the offset from the beginning of the file, in bytes, at
        which the first byte of the segment resides.

    VirtualAddress - Stores the virtual address at which the first byte of the
        segment resides in memory.

    PhysicalAddress - Stores the physical address at which the segment resides.
        This field is almost always the same as the virtual address.

    FileSize - Stores the number of bytes in the file image of the segment. It
        may be zero.

    MemorySize - Stores the number of bytes in the memory image of the segment.
        It may be zero.

    Alignment - Stores the power of two alignment requirement for the segment.
        Values of 0 and 1 mean that no alignment is required.
