# Minoca OS

Minoca OS is a general purpose operating system written from scratch. It aims to be lean, maintainable, modular, and compatible with existing software. It features a POSIX-like interface towards application software, and a growing suite of popular packages already built and ready to go. On the backend, it contains a powerful driver model between device drivers and the kernel. The driver model enables drivers to be written in a forward compatible manner, so that kernel level components can be upgraded without necessarily requiring a recompilation of all device drivers.

Minoca OS is event driven, preemptible, SMP ready, and network capable. It currently runs on x86 PCs and a range of ARM boards.

### Getting Started
If you're just looking to try out Minoca OS, head over to our [download](https://www.minocacorp.com/download/) page to grab the latest stable images. The rest of this page describes how to use this repository to build your own custom image of Minoca OS.

## Building Minoca OS
The paragraphs below will get you from a fresh clone to a built image.

### Environment
The Minoca OS build environment is keyed off of a few environment variables you'll need to set in order to orient the build system:
 - `SRCROOT` - Contains the absolute path to the base source directory. This respository is expected to be in a directory called `os` inside `SRCROOT`. If the third-party or tools repositories are present, they should be in directories called `third-party` and `tools` respectively underneath `SRCROOT`. For example, if you had checked out this repository into `~/src/os`, then in your shell you'd run `export SRCROOT=~/src`.
 - `ARCH` - Contains the architecture to build Minoca OS for (aka the target architecture). Valid values are `armv6`, `armv7`, and `x86`.
 - `VARIANT` - Contains the architecture variant, if any. Leave this unset most of the time. Currently the only valid value is `q` for the `x86` architecture, which builds for the Intel Quark.
 - `DEBUG` - Describes whether to build Minoca OS for debugging or release. Valid values are `dbg` for debug or `rel` for release. We always build `dbg`.
 - `PATH` - You'll need to have `$SRCROOT/$ARCH$VARIANT$DEBUG/tools/bin` in your path to build successfully.

### Prerequisites
To build Minoca OS you'll need a Minoca-specific toolchain for the particular architecture you're building. Prebuilt toolchains can be found [here](https://www.minocacorp.com/download/#toolchain). If you want to build the toolchain from sources, you'll need to check out the [third-party](https://gitlab.com/minoca/third-party) repository and run "make tools" in there.
> Note: If you want to build your own toolchain on Windows, you may find the [tools](https://gitlab.com/minoca/tools) repository helpful, as it contains a native MinGW compiler, make, and other tools needed to bootstrap a toolchain on Windows.

### Build
Run `make` to build the OS for the particular architecture you've supplied. Parallel make is supported. The final output of the build will be several .img files located in `$SRCROOT/$ARCH$VARIANT$DEBUG/bin/*.img`. For example, the PC image is usually located at `$SRCROOT/x86dbg/bin/pc.img`. This is a raw hard disk file that can be applied directly to a hard drive or USB stick to boot Minoca OS. The image `install.img` is a generic installation archive that the `msetup` tool can use to create new Minoca OS installations on target disks or partitions.

Object files are generated in `$SRCROOT/$ARCH$VARIANT$DEBUG/obj/os`. You can run `make clean`, or simply delete this directory, to cause the os repository to completely rebuild. Alternatively, you can run `make wipe` to delete all generated files, including the third-party tools you built or downloaded. Running `make wipe` simply deletes `$SRCROOT/$ARCH$VARIANT$DEBUG/`. We usually stick to `make clean` since `make wipe` requires a complete rebuild of the toolchain.

A note for macOS users: We've managed to build successfully using both GCC from XCode 8 (really clang) and Homebrew GCC, both using the 10.12 SDK. Some users have reported that they need to export `SDKROOT=$(xcrun --show-sdk-path)` to build properly.

### Running
To boot your built images, you can write the appropriate image for the platform you're trying to boot to a USB flash drive or hard disk. On Windows, you can use the Win32DiskImager tool (included in the [tools](https://gitlab.com/minoca/tools) repository under win32/Win32DiskImager). You can also use the msetup tool to build custom images. If you use the msetup tool to install Minoca OS onto a partition of a disk containing other partitions that you care about (such as on the same machine you're building from), we highly recommend making a complete backup of your disk. Minoca OS is still new, and we wouldn't want a bad bug to wipe out all your data.

If you're building Minoca OS on Windows and have downloaded the [tools](https://gitlab.com/minoca/tools) repository, several shortcuts have been set up to allow you to quickly run a Qemu instance with the images you've just built. Make sure you fired up the development environment with the setenv.cmd script. Type `run`, then `dx` to fire up an x86 Qemu instance of pc.img with a kernel debugger attached. We use this internally for faster development. If building for ARM, it's `runarm` and `da`.
