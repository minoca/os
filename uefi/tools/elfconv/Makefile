#   Binary Name:
#
#       ElfConv
#
#   Abstract:
#
#       This module builds the ElfConv utility, which converts an ELF image
#       into a PE image. UEFI exclusively loads PE images, which is why the
#       conversion is necessary. With certain restrictions (such as the lack
#       of dynamic libraries) conversion is doable, though not a lot of fun.
