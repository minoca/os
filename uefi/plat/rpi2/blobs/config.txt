# As of 4-Nov-2014 the firmware defaults to swap the red and blue channels.
# Disable this as the video core mailbox still reports BGR, which is incorrect
# when the swap is enabled.

#
# Set this to disable the default overscans chosen by the Raspberry Pi firmware.

# Overscan adjustment parameters. Use positive numbers if the console goes off
# the screen, and negative numbers if there is too much border.

# Force a display size. The default uses the display's size minus the overscan.

# Force use of HDMI if it is not being detected and composite output is showing.

# Force an HDMI group type, rather than relying on the EDID value.

#
# Force an HDMI mode type, rather than relying on the EDID value.

#hdmi_mode=1

#
# Force HDMI mode to get audio. The default is DVI mode without audio.

#
# Force the UART to 3 MHz. The Raspberry Pi 3 UART runs at 48 MHz for the
# Bluetooth module, but it is not yet enabled. Minoca OS uses the UART for
