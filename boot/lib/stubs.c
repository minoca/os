MmAllocatePool (
    POOL_TYPE PoolType,
    UINTN Size,
    ULONG Tag
    )

/*++

Routine Description:

    This routine allocates memory from a kernel pool.

Arguments:

    PoolType - Supplies the type of pool to allocate from. Valid choices are:

        PoolTypeNonPaged - This type of memory will never be paged out. It is a
        scarce resource, and should only be allocated if paged pool is not
        an option. This memory is marked no-execute.

        PoolTypePaged - This is normal memory that may be transparently paged if
        memory gets tight. The caller may not touch paged pool at run-levels at
        or above dispatch, and is not suitable for DMA (as its physical address
        may change unexpectedly.) This pool type should be used for most normal
        allocations. This memory is marked no-execute.

    Size - Supplies the size of the allocation, in bytes.

    Tag - Supplies an identifier to associate with the allocation, useful for
        debugging and leak detection.

Return Value:

    Returns the allocated memory if successful, or NULL on failure.

MmFreePool (
    POOL_TYPE PoolType,
    PVOID Allocation
    )

/*++

Routine Description:

    This routine frees memory allocated from a kernel pool.

Arguments:

    PoolType - Supplies the type of pool the memory was allocated from. This
        must agree with the type of pool the allocation originated from, or
        the system will become unstable.

    Allocation - Supplies a pointer to the allocation to free. This pointer
        may not be referenced after this function completes.

Return Value:

    None.

MmValidateMemoryAccessForDebugger (

/*++

Routine Description:

    This routine validates that access to a specified location in memory will
    not cause a page fault.

Arguments:

    Address - Supplies the virtual address of the memory that will be read or
        written.

    Length - Supplies how many bytes at that location the caller would like to
        read or write.

    Writable - Supplies an optional pointer that receives a boolean indicating
        whether or not the memory range is mapped writable.

Return Value:

    Returns the number of bytes from the beginning of the address that are
    accessible. If the memory is completely available, the return value will be
    equal to the Length parameter. If the memory is completely paged out, 0
    will be returned.

Routine Description:

    This routine modifies the mapping properties for the page that contains the
    given address.

Arguments:

    Address - Supplies the virtual address of the memory whose mapping
        properties are to be changed.

    Writable - Supplies a boolean indicating whether or not to make the page
        containing the address writable (TRUE) or read-only (FALSE).

    WasWritable - Supplies a pointer that receives a boolean indicating whether
        or not the page was writable (TRUE) or read-only (FALSE) before any
        modifications.

Return Value:

    None.

Routine Description:

    has occurred. This function does not return.

Arguments:

    CrashCode - Supplies the reason for the system crash.

    CrashCodeString - Supplies the string corresponding to the given crash
        code. This parameter is generated by the macro, and should not be
        filled in directly.
