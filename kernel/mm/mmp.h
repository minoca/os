Structure Description:

    This structure defines a section of memory.

Members:

    ReferenceCount - Stores the reference count of the image section.

    Flags - Stores flags regarding the image section. See IMAGE_SECTION_*
        definitions.

    AddressListEntry - Stores pointers to the next and previous sections in the
        address space.

    ImageListEntry - Stores pointers to the next and previous sections that
        also inherit page cache pages from the same backing image.

    CopyListEntry - Stores pointers to the next and previous sections also
        inheriting from the parent section.

    Parent - Stores a pointer to the parent section this one inherits from.

    ChildList - Stores the list of image sections inheriting from this one.

    AddressSpace - Stores a pointer to the address space this section belongs
        to.

    VirtualAddress - Stores the virtual address this section is mapped to.

    Lock - Stores a pointer to the image section lock.

    PagingInIrp - Stores a pointer to the IRP used to swap pages in from the
        page file.

    SwapSpace - Stores 1 page of free VA space that can be used as swap space
        while pages are being paged in or out.

    DirtyPageBitmap - Stores a pointer to a bitmap describing which pages are
        clean (and can thus be backed by an image) and which pages are
        dirty (and therefore must be backed by the page file).

    InheritPageBitmap - Stores a pointer to a bitmap describing which pages
        should be inherited from the parent.

    Size - Stores the size of the section, in bytes.

    TruncateCount - Stores the number of times pages from this image section
        have been unmapped due to truncation. This is used to detect evictions
        during page in while the lock is released.

    PageFileBacking - Stores the page file backing, if needed.

    ImageBacking - Stores the image file backing, if needed.

    ImageBackingReferenceCount - Stores the reference count for the image
        backing handle specifically. This is kept separately so that it can be
        closed earlier, preventing the paging thread from holding the bag of
        closing this handle (which is paged).

    MinTouched - Stores the minimum address that has been accessed.

    MaxTouched - Stores the maximum address that has been accessed.

/*++

Routine Description:

    This routine initializes the physical page allocator, given the system
    memory map. It carves off as many pages as it needs for its own purposes,
    and initializes the rest in the physical page allocator.

Arguments:

    MemoryMap - Supplies a pointer to the current memory layout of the system.

    InitMemory - Supplies a pointer where a pointer to the initialization
        memory provided by the loader is given on input. On output, this
        pointer is advanced beyond what this routine allocated from it.

    InitMemorySize - Supplies a pointer that on input contains the size of the
        init memory region. On output, this will be advanced beyond what was
        allocated by this function.

Return Value:

    STATUS_SUCCESS on success.

    STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER if the memory map is invalid.

    STATUS_NO_MEMORY if not enough memory is present to initialize the physical
        memory allocator.

Routine Description:

    This routine allocates a physical page of memory. If necessary, it will

    worker thread. All allocate pages start out as non-paged and must be
    made pagable.

Arguments:

    PageCount - Supplies the number of consecutive physical pages required.

    Alignment - Supplies the alignment requirement of the allocation, in pages.
        Valid values are powers of 2. Values of 1 or 0 indicate no alignment

Routine Description:

    This routine allocates physical memory that can be identity mapped to

    must only be used internally and in a very controlled environment.

Arguments:

    PageCount - Supplies the number of consecutive physical pages required.

    Alignment - Supplies the alignment requirement of the allocation, in pages.
        Valid values are powers of 2. Values of 1 or 0 indicate no alignment

/*++

Routine Description:

    This routine allocates physical memory for MM init routines. It should only
    be used during early MM initialization. If the physical page allocator is
    up, this routine will attempt to use that, otherwise it will carve memory
    directly off the memory map.

Arguments:

    MemoryMap - Supplies a pointer to the system memory map.

    PageCount - Supplies the number of physical pages needed.
