    Address - Supplies the address to flush.

    Size - Supplies the number of bytes in the region to flush.

Return Value:

Routine Description:

    This routine releases an external reference on a file object taken by
    referencing the file object for a handle.

Arguments:

    FileObject - Supplies the opaque pointer to the file object.

Return Value:

    None. The caller should not count on this pointer remaining unique after
    this call returns.

Routine Description:

Arguments:

    Object - Supplies a pointer to the object to add a reference to. This

Routine Description:

    This routine decreases the reference count of an object by 1. If this
    causes the reference count of the object to drop to 0, the object will be
    freed. This also decreases the reference count of the object's parents up
    the tree, which may also cause the parent objects to be freed if this was
    the last reference on them.

Arguments:

    Object - Supplies a pointer to the object to subtract a reference from.
        This structure is presumed to begin with an OBJECT_HEADER structure.

Return Value:

    None.

/*++

Routine Description:

    This routine creates a new system object.

Arguments:

    Type - Supplies the type of object being created.

    Parent - Supplies a pointer to the object that this object is a child under.
        Supply NULL to create an object off the root node.

    ObjectName - Supplies an optional name for the object. A copy of this
        string will be made unless the flags specify otherwise.

    NameLength - Supplies the length of the name string in bytes, including
        the null terminator.

    DataSize - Supplies the size of the object body, *including* the object
        header.

    DestroyRoutine - Supplies an optional pointer to a function to be called
        when the reference count of the object drops to zero (immediately before
        the object is deallocated).

    Flags - Supplies optional flags indicating various properties of the object.
        See OBJECT_FLAG_* definitions.

    Tag - Supplies the pool tag that should be used for the memory allocation.

Return Value:

    Returns a pointer to the new object, on success. The returned structure is
        assumed to start with an OBJECT_HEADER structure.

    NULL if the object could not be allocated, the object already exists, or
        an invalid parameter was passed in.

/*++

Routine Description:

    This routine waits on multiple objects until one (or all in some cases) is
    signaled. The caller is responsible for maintaining references to these
    objects.

Arguments:

    ObjectArray - Supplies an array of object pointers containing the objects
        to wait on. Each object must only be on the list once.

    ObjectCount - Supplies the number of elements in the array.

    Flags - Supplies a bitfield of flags governing the behavior of the wait.
        See WAIT_FLAG_* definitions.

    TimeoutInMilliseconds - Supplies the number of milliseconds that the given
        objects should be waited on before timing out. Use WAIT_TIME_INDEFINITE
        to wait forever on these objects.

    PreallocatedWaitBlock - Supplies an optional pointer to a pre-allocated
        wait block to use for the wait. This is optional, however if there are
        a large number of objects to wait on and this is a common operation, it
        is a little faster to pre-allocate a wait block and reuse it.

    SignalingObject - Supplies an optional pointer where the object that
        satisfied the wait will be returned on success. If the wait was
        interrupted, this returns NULL. If the WAIT_FLAG_ALL_OBJECTS flag was
        not specified, the first object to be signaled will be returned. If the
        WAIT_FLAG_ALL_OBJECTS was specified, the caller should not depend on
        a particular object being returned here.

Return Value:

    Status code.

Arguments:

    Table - Supplies a pointer to the handle table.

    Handle - Supplies the handle returned when the handle was created.

    Flags - Supplies an optional pointer that receives value of the handle's
        flags.

Return Value:

    Returns the value associated with that handle upon success.

    NULL if the given handle is invalid.
