Routine Description:

    This routine attempts to mount the given target on the given mount point.

Arguments:

    FromKernelMode - Supplies a boolean indicating the request is coming from
        kernel mode.

    MountPointPath - Supplies a pointer to the string containing the path to
        where the target is to be mounted.

    MountPointPathSize - Supplies the size of the mount point path string in
        bytes, including the null terminator.

    TargetPath - Supplies a pointer to the string containing the path to the
        target file, directory, volume, pipe, socket, or device that is to be
        mounted.

    TargetPathSize - Supplies the size of the target path string in bytes,
        including the null terminator.

    MountFlags - Supplies the flags associated with the mount operation. See
        MOUNT_FLAG_* for definitions.

    AccessFlags - Supplies the flags associated with the mount point's access
        permissions. See IO_ACCESS_FLAG_* for definitions.

Return Value:

    Status code.

/*++

Routine Description:

    This routine links the given mount point to other locations in the mount
    tree where its mount path entry can be found. At those locations, it will
    create new mount points that join the mount path entry to the given target.
    This routine assumes the global mount lock is held exclusively.

Arguments:

    MountPoint - Supplies a pointer to the mount point that is to be linked.

    Target - Supplies a pointer to the target path point for the linked mount
        points.

    MountList - Supplies a pointer to the head of the list where all newly
        created mount points will be stored, on both success and failure, so
        that the caller can either insert them into the live mount tree or
        destroy them once the mount lock is released.

Return Value:

    Status code.
