Structure Description:

    This structure defines a file object.

Members:

    TreeEntry - Stores the Red-Black tree node information for this file object,
        used internally. Never access these members directly.

    ListEntry - Stores an entry into the list of file objects.

    PageCacheTree - Stores a tree root for the page cache entries that
        belong to this file object.

    DirtyPageList - Stores the head of the list of dirty page cache entries
        in this file object. This list is synchronized by the global page
        cache list lock.

    ReferenceCount - Stores the memory reference count on this structure, used
        internally. Never manipulate this member directly.

    PathEntryCount - Stores the count of path entries that are using this file
        object. This accounts for all ways that a file object whose hard link
        count has gone to zero can still be accessed. If a path entry is using
        it, I/O can still be done on the file object.

    Device - Stores a pointer to the device or volume that owns the file serial
        number.

    Directory - Stores a pointer to an open handle to the file's directory,
        which is used to synchronize deletes, opens, and metadata updates.

    Lock - Stores a pointer to the lock that serializes I/O operations on
        this file object and child path entry lookup, creation, and insertion.

    IoState - Stores a pointer to the I/O object state for this file object.

    SpecialIo - Stores a pointer to the context needed to do I/O if this is a
        special object (like a pipe, terminal, socket, or shared memory object).

    ReadyEvent - Stores a pointer to an event that must be waited on before
        using this file object.

    ImageSectionList - Stores a pointer to a list of image setions that map
        portions of this file object.

    DeviceContext - Stores a pointer to context supplied by the device with the
        file was opened.

    Flags - Stores a set of flags describing the file object state. See
        FILE_OBJECT_FLAG_* for definitions. This must be modified with atomic
        operations.

    Properties - Stores the characteristics for this file.

    FileLockList - Stores the head of the list of file locks held on this
        file object. This is a user mode thing.

    FileLockEvent - Stores a pointer to the event that's signalled when a file
        object lock is released.

        list.

    State - Stores the current state of the device.

    StateHistoryNextIndex - Stores the index of where the next device state
        should be written to. The state history is a circular buffer.

    ActiveChildList - Store the head of the list of this device's active
        children.

    ActiveListEntry - Stores the list entry for the device's place in its
        parent's list of active children.

    Lock - Stores a pointer to a shared exclusive lock that synchronizes
        device removal with IRPs. Lock order is always parent, then child.

    ParentDevice - Stores a pointer to the device that created this device, aka
        the device's parent. Usually this points to the parent bus. This can
        be NULL for unenumerable devices.

        queue's state and list.

    QueueState - Stores the state of the work queue, describing whether or not
        it is accepting new requests. Writes of this variable are protected by
        the QueueLock.

    WorkQueue - Stores the list head of the device work queue. Access to this
        list is protected by the QueueLock. See the DEVICE_WORK_ENTRY
        definition.

        of this head points to the top of the driver stack (the functional
        driver or uppermost filter).

        selected in the device's resource configuration list.

    BusLocalResources - Stores a pointer to the device's committed resources, as
        seen from the point of view of the device itself. These
        are the resources that the bus driver is likely use when programming
        things like the device's Base Address Registers.

    ProcessorLocalResources - Stores a pointer to the device's committed
        resources, as seen from the CPU complex. These are the resources the
        device driver would use to communicate with the device.

    BootResources - Stores a pointer to the resources the BIOS assigned to the
        device at boot.

    Power - Stores the power management information for the device.
